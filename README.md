### **Introduction**
Pokemon started with the initial 151 different species in the Kanto region. Over the many years garnering huge popularity, now there are at least 6 regions and over 700 pokemon. This site has the breakdown of pokmon by the 18 different types, as well as the 6 different regions. Feel free to navigate around to see the first few familiar pokemon, and find out more about the newer ones.

The website contains the following information:

### **User Experience (UX)**

**User stories:**  
For someone who is new to pokemon, i want to:  
- Navigate freely to search for the pokemon i want to know more about
- Know what pokemon falls under which types
- Be able to select the pokemon i want to know more about

For someone loves pokemon and have been following pokemon:
- Know what pokemon falls under which types
- Know the ability of pokemon selected

- Reminisce over the old pokemon and the current newer ones 

When the user first arrives at the website:

### **UI & Features**

**UI**
- The pokemon logo and the traditional pokeball and pikachu image shows this site is about pokemon
- The types have a type icon/symbol as well to better portray
- When hover above the searched pokemon, the card will enlarge and background colour changed 
- There is a small pokemon at the bottom right to allow scroll to top function
- Click into the pokemon to move to another page, with more images and details about the pokemon
- The pokemon page on another html has a return button to return to the search page
- In small devices, the bar chart will disappear


**Features left to implement**
- Instead of radio button, to improve using checkboxes and hence allowing advanced or multi-search capabilities (types and regions together, search using more than 1 type etc)

### **Technologies used**
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap 
4. Javascript 
5. Jquery

- iphone 5/se
- iphone 6/7/8
- iphone 6/7/8 plus
- iphone X
- ipad
- ipad pro
- google chrome 
- microsoft edge
- safari
- internet explorer

Basic checks include:

- Ensuring that the scripts are working fine, and the functions are working well
- Ensuring that the scroll to top button is functioning normally
- Ensuring that the site looks consistent across all major browsers and mobile devices of various sizes 
- Checked that its able to navigate to the next html page showing the correct information
- Checked that the pokemon are sorted in sequence, and image fit nicely within the cards for all devices
- Checked that there were no grammatical errors

Bugs found:
- The symbols for types does not fit quite nicely in ipad pro "portrait" view
- Some newer pokemon do not have back images as the sprites were not available in the api
